    <p>Kerala, southwestern coastal state of India. It is a small state, constituting only about 1 percent of the total
        area of the country. Kerala stretches for about 360 miles (580 km) along the Malabar Coast, varying in width
        from roughly 20 to 75 miles (30 to 120 km). It is bordered by the states of Karnataka (formerly Mysore) to the
        north and Tamil Nadu to the east and by the Arabian Sea to the south and west; it also surrounds Mahe, a segment
        of the state of Puducherry, on the northwestern coast. The capital is Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum).
        The forests yield valuable timbers such as ebony, rosewood, and teak. In addition, Keralaâ€™s woodlands supply
        industrial raw materials such as bamboo (used in the paper and rayon industries), wood pulp, charcoal, gums, and
        resins. The state is also a national leader in fish production. Sardines, tunas, mackerels, and prawns are among
        the principal products of the industry.
